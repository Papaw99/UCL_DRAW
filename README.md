# UCL Draw Software

Following the UCL Round of 16 draw dibacle on the 13th of December 2021, it was revealed that a faulty system was to blame for
the irregularities observed in the first draw. This led to a subsequent second draw in which human verification was employed to
ensure the draw is executed perfectly. We live in the age of computers and systems like these should be able to run independently
without any human adjudicator. An organization likeUEFA should have no issue in creating a system that works flawlessly but
clearly a multi-billion dollar organization like their's has failed to produce a fully functioning software. I've made this very
basic version of what their software to show how easy it is to make a reliable yet simple software. In short, I got bored and
after watching their software melt down, I thought "You know what? Why not have a go at making one of my own?"
